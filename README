Here are the programs I wrote to speed up the
grading process required by the Humboldt State
University Department of Environmental Resources Engineering.

sorter.sh 
  sorts student submissions
    creates individual student lab directories
    unzips .tar submission 
    copies grading rubric to studet directories

rubric.py 
  requests laboratory feedback
